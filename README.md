# Helpful.SQL
A library of helpers for generating SQL for tasks which aren't normally supported by ORM's.

Currently this supports statements based on large 'IN' clauses. 

See [here](https://codingdaddy.dobbs.technology/2018/03/30/dont-stream-json-data-part-2/) for an example of where this can be useful.
